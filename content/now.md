This page is inspired by <span class="h-card"><a class="p-name u-url" href="https://sivers.org">Derek Sivers</a></span>'s post [_The /now page movement_](https://sivers.org/nowff) and [the Now Movement](https://nownownow.com/about). The purpose of this page is to share what I'm currently focussed on, and will be updated as things change.

This is both for longer-lived interests and shorter-lived "what I'm currently doing".

What am I up to right now?
